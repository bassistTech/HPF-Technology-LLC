File sharing repository for HPF Technology, LLC

Thanks for visiting! This repo contains all downloadable files supporting my main web page:

https://sites.google.com/site/hpftechllc/

The HPF Technology business is commercial, of course, but I believe in sharing design
information for the sake of hobbyists, repair technicians, and the genera public good.

Keeping these files on a git repo seems like the most convenient way to manage the
content, since I can easily "push" updates from my home computer. Since I just started
this repo, many of the files are in "closed" formats because I created them in
proprietary software such as MS Word, but my plan is to open them up as I get the
chance to do so.

* Organization: Messy
* Bugs and errors: Many
* Updates: Sluggish
